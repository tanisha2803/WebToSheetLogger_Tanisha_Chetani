## Day 4 Implementation

### Features Added
- **Google Apps Script Integration:** Created a backend service to handle data storage

### Google Apps Script Setup
1. Created a Google Sheet with columns:
   - Text
   - URL
   - Title
   - Timestamp
2. Implemented Apps Script with:
   - POST endpoint for receiving data
   - Data validation
   - Error handling
   - Success/error responses

### Testing Instructions
1. Open any webpage
2. Select some text

## Day 5 Implementation

### Features Added
- **Full Integration:** The extension now fully connects the frontend (content script) to the backend (Google Apps Script Web App).
- **POST Request:** When the user confirms saving a highlight, the extension sends a POST request with the selected text, page title, URL, and timestamp to the Apps Script endpoint.
- **Success/Error Feedback:** The extension displays a success message if the data is saved, or an error message if something goes wrong.
- **No Manifest URL Needed:** The Apps Script Web App URL is hardcoded in the content script; it does not need to be listed in the manifest.

### How It Works
1. User highlights text on any webpage.
2. The floating "Save to Sheet" button appears near the selection.
3. On clicking the button, a confirmation popup previews the data to be saved.
4. When the user confirms, the extension sends a POST request to the Google Apps Script Web App URL:
   - Example endpoint: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbw0oyDX1ap_AMgzQJ6IiRqv3w9tFiCg5X4_ea4PThYfYm6FXDXKl4mp3F_YkfgOY-Se/exec`
   - Data sent (JSON):
     ```json
     {
       "text": "Selected text...",
       "url": "https://example.com/page",
       "title": "Page Title",
       "timestamp": "2025-05-19T14:25:00"
     }
     ```
5. The Apps Script receives the data and appends it as a new row in the connected Google Sheet.
6. The extension shows a success or error message to the user.

### Files Modified
- `content.js`: Handles the POST request, user feedback, and error handling.
- `manifest.json`: Ensures permissions for web requests and content scripts.

### Testing Instructions
1. Open any webpage.
2. Select some text.
3. Click the "Save to Sheet" button and confirm in the popup.
4. Check your Google Sheet for the new entry.
5. Observe the success or error message in the browser.
