üìÅ Repository Structure and Key Files
manifest.json: Defines the extension's metadata, permissions, and the files it uses. This is a crucial file for any Chrome extension, specifying how the extension should behave.
background.js: Contains background scripts that run independently of web pages. These scripts can handle events like browser startup, tab updates, and more.
content.js: Injected into web pages, this script can manipulate the DOM, listen for events, or communicate with the background script.
popup.js and hello.html: Likely constitute the user interface displayed when the extension icon is clicked. popup.js would handle the logic, while hello.html defines the structure and content.
images/: Presumably contains icons or other graphical assets used by the extension.
üîç Potential Functionality
Given the standard structure and naming, this extension might be designed to:

Interact with Web Pages: Using content.js, the extension could modify or extract information from web pages.
Provide a User Interface: Through hello.html and popup.js, users might interact with the extension, triggering certain actions or viewing information.
Handle Background Processes: background.js could manage tasks that need to run continuously or respond to browser events.
Without specific code or documentation, the exact functionality remains speculative.
